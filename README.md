# Biometeric-Attendance-Unit

A small battery operated finger-print scanner attendance unit. The intention of this device was to accurately record the attendance of pupils in class without disruption class proceedings, which is often the case in a regular roll-call. I designed a multi-layered secure login where the professor is first authenticated, then he selects his class for students to record their prints. All logs were tabulated in an on-board SD card. Additionally, the program calculated the cumulative attendance of each student and highlighted defaulters based on a user defined minimum threshold percentage. It was awarded the second position at the State Level Project Competition in Mumbai, India.
